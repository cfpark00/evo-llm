# Development Log: Infrastructure Setup and Testing

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Time**: ~12:14 (reconstructed from closing tasks)
**Developer**: Previous developer (log written retrospectively)

## Summary

Completed initial infrastructure setup for ES-based LLM fine-tuning project. Built and tested key components: Countdown task integration, LoRA adapter creation, and SGLang evaluation pipeline skeleton.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- ✅ Initialized project following CLAUDE.md conventions
- ✅ Set up uv package management with all dependencies
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation (research_context.md, repo_usage.md)
- ✅ Cloned and integrated paper's countdown task as git submodule

### 2. Countdown Task Integration (`/scratch/countdown_test/`)
**File**: `test_countdown.py` (183 lines)

Successfully tested base model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on countdown task:
- Loaded countdown dataset from paper's implementation
- Implemented chat template parsing for Qwen format
- Integrated reward function from paper (format + answer rewards)
- Ran inference on 5 examples with greedy decoding
- Saved structured results with reward breakdowns

**Key Findings**:
- Model loads successfully in bfloat16 on GPU
- Chat template properly handles system + user messages
- Reward function works as expected (0-1 range)
- Results saved with timestamp for reproducibility

### 3. LoRA Adapter Creation (`/scratch/sglang_lora_test/`)
**File**: `init_loras.py` (165 lines)

Created infrastructure for LoRA-based population members:
- Generated 5 initial LoRA adapters (lora_0 through lora_4)
- Configuration: rank=1, alpha=2, target layers 0-10
- Target modules: All attention (q/k/v/o_proj) + MLP (gate/up/down_proj)
- Total: 77 target modules (7 modules/layer × 11 layers)

**Technical Details**:
- Saved adapters in safetensors format
- Shared tokenizer across all adapters
- Generated metadata.json for tracking configuration
- Each adapter: ~0.01% of full model parameters (very lightweight!)

**Output Structure**:
```
lora_adapters/
├── lora_0/ ... lora_4/     # Individual adapters
│   ├── adapter_config.json
│   └── adapter_model.safetensors
├── tokenizer/              # Shared tokenizer
└── metadata.json           # Configuration tracking
```

### 4. ES Loop Skeleton (`/scratch/sglang_lora_test/`)
**File**: `es_test_run.py` (389 lines)

Implemented minimal ES framework structure:

**Components Built**:
1. `SGLangLoRAEvaluator` class:
   - HTTP client for SGLang chat completions API
   - Health check functionality
   - Per-LoRA inference with greedy decoding

2. Countdown evaluation pipeline:
   - Parse countdown context into chat messages
   - Generate responses via SGLang
   - Compute rewards using paper's reward function
   - Aggregate results across population

3. LoRA manipulation utilities:
   - `load_lora_weights()` - Load from safetensors
   - `save_lora_weights()` - Save to safetensors
   - `compute_advantage_weighted_average()` - Aggregate top performers
   - `perturb_lora()` - Add Gaussian noise (σ=0.001)

4. Evolution loop structure:
   - Generation 0: Evaluate 5 existing LoRAs
   - Generations 1-4: Perturb → evaluate → aggregate
   - Track rewards, save evolution history

**Current Limitations** (acknowledged in code):
- ⚠️ Dynamic LoRA loading NOT implemented yet
- ⚠️ Generations 1-4 use placeholder random rewards
- ⚠️ SGLang server must be manually started with all LoRAs preloaded
- Generation 0 evaluation assumes server running with lora0-lora4 loaded

**Evolution Algorithm** (simplified NES):
```
For each generation t:
1. Compute advantages = (reward - mean) / std
2. Weighted average: θ_t = Σ(advantage_i * θ_i) / Σ(advantage_i)
3. Perturb: θ_new = θ_t + ε, where ε ~ N(0, σ²I)
4. Evaluate new population
5. Repeat
```

### 5. Supporting Scripts
Created executable bash runners:
- `run_test.sh` - Run countdown test
- `run_init.sh` - Initialize LoRA adapters
- `run_es_test.sh` - Run ES loop (partial)
- `start_sglang_server.sh` - Start SGLang with multi-LoRA support

## Technical Decisions Made

### Why Rank 1 LoRA?
- Minimal parameters (fastest iteration)
- Test hypothesis: is low-rank sufficient for ES perturbations?
- Can scale up if needed, but start simple

### Why Layers 0-10 only?
- Early/mid layers (out of ~28 total for Qwen2.5-7B)
- Hypothesis: early layers capture task-relevant features
- Reduces parameter count for faster testing

### Why Greedy Decoding?
- Deterministic evaluation (reproducibility)
- Reduces variance in reward estimates
- Matches paper's evaluation protocol

### Why Advantage-Weighted Average?
- Natural Evolutionary Strategies (NES) approach from paper
- Z-score normalization prevents outlier domination
- Theoretically grounded (matches policy gradient direction)

## Open Questions / Blockers

### Critical Blocker: Dynamic LoRA Loading
**Problem**: SGLang's dynamic loading API is not fully documented
- Current workaround: Preload all LoRAs at server startup
- Limitation: Can't create new LoRAs during evolution (beyond initial 5)
- Need to investigate: SGLang v0.4.10+ dynamic loading endpoints

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Restart server each generation (slow, but works)
2. Find/implement dynamic loading API
3. Use persistent server with LoRA cache management

### Research Questions
1. **Is rank 1 sufficient?**
   - Need baseline experiments to validate
   - May need rank 4-8 for meaningful perturbations

2. **LoRA averaging mechanics**
   - Currently averaging both A and B matrices
   - Is this mathematically correct for low-rank decomposition?
   - Should we average ΔW = BA instead?

3. **Noise scale tuning**
   - Using σ=0.001 from paper
   - May need different scale for low-rank space
   - Need sensitivity analysis

4. **Evaluation protocol**
   - How many examples needed for stable reward estimates?
   - Currently using 5 examples (very small!)
   - Tradeoff: accuracy vs computation

## Code Quality Notes

### What Went Well
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (evaluator, evolution, I/O)
- ✅ Explicit error handling (health checks, validation)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and progress tracking
- ✅ Saved metadata for reproducibility
- ✅ Followed fail-fast philosophy (crashes on missing server)

### Technical Debt
- ⚠️ Hardcoded absolute paths (not using configs)
- ⚠️ No proper logging framework (using print statements)
- ⚠️ All code in `/scratch/` (not production-ready)
- ⚠️ No unit tests
- ⚠️ Placeholder logic for generations 1-4

## Next Steps (Not Yet Done)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Solve dynamic LoRA loading**
   - Research SGLang API documentation
   - Test dynamic loading endpoints
   - Implement server restart fallback if needed

2. **End-to-end test**
   - Start SGLang server with 5 LoRAs
   - Run generation 0 evaluation (real rewards)
   - Validate reward computation matches countdown_test results

3. **Move to production structure**
   - Extract ES framework → `src/es_framework.py`
   - Create orchestration script → `src/scripts/es_train.py`
   - Create config template → `configs/experiments/countdown_es.yaml`
   - Create runner → `scripts/experiments/train_countdown_es.sh`

### Medium-term Goals
1. Run full 5-generation ES loop with real evaluations
2. Implement proper experiment tracking (W&B integration)
3. Compare LoRA-based ES vs base model baseline
4. Validate rank 1 is sufficient (or increase rank)
5. Test noise scale sensitivity

### Research Milestones
- [ ] Milestone 1: Implement ES loop with LoRA ✓ (partial - skeleton done)
- [ ] Verify convergence on toy problem
- [ ] Reproduce paper's Countdown task results (with LoRA adaptation)
- [ ] Characterize ES vs base model differences

## Reflection

**What Worked**:
- Systematic testing of each component independently
- Starting simple (rank 1, 5 examples, 5 adapters)
- Fail-fast approach caught SGLang server issues early
- Good documentation of design decisions

**What Could Be Better**:
- Should have tested dynamic LoRA loading earlier
- Hardcoded paths make code brittle
- No logging infrastructure from the start
- Should have written configs first, then code

**Key Insight**:
The LoRA-based ES approach is promising - adapters are tiny (~0.01% of params) making storage/loading fast. The challenge is infrastructure (SGLang dynamic loading), not the algorithm itself.
