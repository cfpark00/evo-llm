## Major Work Completed

### 1. LoRA Initialization Debugging

**Problem identified:**
- Production ES had dramatically worse results than scratch test
- Senior engineer suspected LoRA initialization/perturbation differences

**Root cause analysis:**
- Compared `scratch/sglang_lora_test/init_loras.py` vs `src/scripts/es_train.py`
- Found initialization was **20x weaker** in production
- **Scratch**: `normal(0, 0.02) × 20 = normal(0, 0.4)` for Gen0
- **Production**: `normal(0, per_layer_noise_scale)` where scale ≈ 0.02-0.19
- Perturbation scales also differed significantly

**Investigation details:**
- Measured actual base model weight magnitudes: Layer 0 mean = 0.953, Layer 2 = 0.190
- Discovered outliers in `o_proj` weights (8.5, 3.15) skewing per-layer means
- Scratch test used hardcoded uniform scales {0: 0.10, 1-9: 0.09}
- Production computed adaptive per-layer scales but was too conservative

**Solution:**
- Introduced two separate scale parameters in config:
  - `init_scale`: Multiplier for Gen0 initialization (set to 4.0 for conciseness)
  - `perturb_scale`: Multiplier for Gen1+ perturbations (set to 1.0)
- Both multiply against per-layer base noise (10% of weight magnitude)
- Reverted all `###TEMP###` hardcoded values
- Clean separation: base noise = adaptive, scales = tunable hyperparameters

**Validation:**
- Temporarily matched scratch exactly with hardcoded values
- Confirmed scratch test working, then introduced proper parameterization
- `init_scale=4.0` gets close to scratch's 0.4 std while keeping adaptivity

### 2. Countdown Task Setup

**Task integration:**
- Fixed `CountdownTask.load_data()` to add `'prompt'` key from `'context'` field
- Countdown data has different schema than conciseness
- Verified reward function matches paper exactly (format + answer validation)
- Confirmed NOT easily cheatable - sorted multiset check prevents most exploits

**Dataset characteristics:**
- Total: 2000 examples
- Train: 1600 (80% split)
- Test: 400 (20% split)
- vs Conciseness: 2 train, 8 test (800x more training data!)

**Efficiency optimization - Training subset cycling:**
- Paper uses `--data_sample 1000` to subsample
- Production was evaluating all 1600 every generation (48K inferences/gen)
- Implemented cycling through subsets while covering full dataset over time
- Added `samples_per_generation` config parameter (optional, backward compatible)
- Countdown uses 128 samples/gen → 3,840 inferences/gen (**12.5x speedup!**)
- Cycles through full dataset: Gen0 = 0-127, Gen1 = 128-255, etc.
- Over 1000 generations: each sample seen ~80 times

**Test set subsampling:**
- Added `test_samples` config parameter for fixed test subset
- Randomly selects N samples at start, reuses same subset throughout
- Deterministic (seed-based) for reproducibility
- Countdown configured with 100 test samples (vs 400 full)

**Config parameters added:**
```yaml
evaluation:
  samples_per_generation: 128  # Cycle through training subsets
  test_samples: 100            # Fixed random test subset
```

### 3. Time Tracking and Visualization

**Comprehensive timing added:**
- Time tracker dictionary initialized at experiment start
- Tracks all major operations:
  - Setup: `weight_analysis`, `init_population`, `server_launch`
  - Per-generation: `loading`, `evaluation`, `es_update`, `create_loras`, `unloading`
  - Overall: `total_experiment`

**Time breakdown visualization:**
- Single horizontal bar chart (`figures/time_breakdown.png`)
- Categories sorted by total time (descending)
- Color-coded bars:
  - Coral = Per-generation operations (evaluation, loading, etc.)
  - Steel blue = One-time setup (server launch, weight analysis, etc.)
- Legend in upper right
- Time labels on each bar
- Console summary table with percentages

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed category extraction logic (was using wrong split, categories were broken)
- Changed from `split('_', 2)` to `split('_', 1)` for proper extraction
- Removed confusing stacked-by-generation plot (kept only category totals)

**Saved artifacts:**
- `results/time_breakdown.json` - Raw timing data
- `figures/time_breakdown.png` - Visual breakdown
- Console prints percentage breakdown at end

## Technical Insights

### LoRA Initialization Mathematics

**Base model weight magnitudes (measured):**
- Highly variable across layers and modules
- Layer 0: mean = 0.953 (skewed by o_proj = 8.5)
- Layer 2: mean = 0.190
- Target modules (q/k/v/o, gate/up/down) vary 0.007 to 8.5

**Noise scale formula:**
```
base_noise_per_layer = mean_magnitude × 0.1
gen0_noise = base_noise_per_layer × init_scale
perturb_noise = base_noise_per_layer × perturb_scale
```

**Example (Layer 0 with init_scale=4.0):**
```
base_noise = 0.953 × 0.1 = 0.095
gen0_std = 0.095 × 4.0 = 0.38
```

This is close to scratch's hardcoded 0.4 while maintaining adaptivity!

### Countdown Reward Function

**Total reward = 0.1 × format_reward + answer_reward**

**Format reward (max 0.1):**
- Full format `<think>...</think><answer>...</answer>`: 1.0
- Think tag only: 0.1
- Answer tag only: 0.5

**Answer reward (max 1.0):**
- Extracts last `<answer>` block
- Validates allowed chars: `[0-9+\-*/() ]+`
- Checks `sorted(used_numbers) == sorted(given_numbers)`
- Evaluates expression with `eval(..., {"__builtins__": None}, {})`
- Returns 1.0 if result == target (within 1e-5)

**Security:** Sorted multiset check prevents most cheating (can't use wrong numbers or wrong quantities)

## Current State

### Working Components
- ✅ ES training script with proper initialization
- ✅ Conciseness task (2 train, 8 test)
- ✅ Countdown task (1600 train, 400 test)
- ✅ Efficient subset cycling for large datasets
- ✅ Comprehensive time tracking and visualization
- ✅ Backward compatible configs

### Configuration
- Conciseness: Full dataset each generation (2 samples)
- Countdown: Cycles 128 samples/gen, 100 test samples
- Both use `init_scale=4.0`, `perturb_scale=1.0`

### Ready for Experiments
- Conciseness: 30 gens × 30 pop × 2 samples = 1.8K inferences
- Countdown: 1000 gens × 30 pop × 128 samples = 3.84M inferences (vs 48M without cycling!)

## Next Steps

1. **Run full countdown experiment** to validate:
   - Init/perturb scales work correctly
   - Subset cycling maintains convergence
   - Time tracking accurate

2. **Compare results** with scratch test baseline

3. **Tune hyperparameters** if needed:
   - Adjust `samples_per_generation` for speed/quality tradeoff
   - Experiment with `init_scale` values

4. **Monitor time breakdown** to identify bottlenecks
